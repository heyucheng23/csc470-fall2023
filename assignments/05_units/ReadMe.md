Based on 05_units, I would like to design a turret defense game

Just like the turret defense games I have played, there will be:

A  16*16 map with start point and end point, and the enemies will follow the path to get from start to the end
Different kinds of enemies that have different speed and health
Movable camera so that player can have a better vision of the game
Health bar of the enemies
Three kinds of turret : standard turret, missile turret, laser beamer 
Each node of the map is able to build a tower
A shop that can choose different kinds of turret
Animations of the turret: shooting, facing the enemies, bullets
Animations when the enemies die
Bullets will automatically get close to the enemies, and finally destroy themselves.
Animations for bullets, missile, and laser
A shop that you can choose turret you want to buy
Gold system to buy different kinds of turret
Set player lives and games over function
Help and start interface at the beginning of the game

Short-term goal: Finish all the requirements above
Long-term goal: Add more levels
